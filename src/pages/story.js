                “Come and see the works of God; He is awesome in His doing toward the sons of
                men”
                Psalm 66:5

                Typically, this is the place where couples tell a cute story of how they met
                and fell in love; that, however, is not what this is. Like every aspect of our
                lives, this is a testimony of how great, how loving, and how merciful the Lord
                has been to us. He can do things so far beyond what we can imagine for
                ourselves, simply because He is good. 

                Before the Lord brought us together, in Fall of 2022, we could not have been
                more different. Our hearts were in very different places, and neither of us
                knew the work the Lord was about to do in our lives. 
                Ryan lived in Ireland and served alongside his family in church. He had no
                desire to pursue any kind of relationship, let alone get married. In fact,
                he had never been in a relationship and was content with keeping it that way
                for the rest of his life. 
                Oli, on the other hand, lived in Utah and had been in a relationship with
                a girl for 2 years. She had no desire to pursue the Lord or His will for her
                life, but soon realized the Lord had so much better for her than what the
                world was offering. This brought her to Bible College in York, where Ryan
                had been attending school for the past year; and we met on September
                11th, 2022.  

                “A man’s heart plans his way, But the Lord directs his steps.”
                Proverbs 16:9

                At that time in our lives, marriage was not something either of us expected or
                planned for. Oli had just come out of a relationship, and desired to deepen
                her love for the Lord, and so was not looking to pursue any relationship
                outside of that at the time. Ryan actively avoided pursuing relationships,
                and was not looking for one either. But, despite our own plans, the Lord
                had much more beautiful things in store for us. 

                Two weeks into the semester, Oli purposed in her heart that the Lord had
                brought her to Bible College to rid her of herself. In her seeking to do so,
                the Lord gave her a dream of Ryan, revealing he would be the man she would
                marry. In trying to steward what the Lord had placed upon her heart,
                she continued in prayer, seeking confirmation from the Lord, and daily
                surrendering it into His hands. Two months later, at a young adults bible
                study, the Lord placed Oli upon Ryan’s heart while in prayer. The Lord told
                him, ‘Oli is the one for you.’ Seeking confirmation, he prayed about when
                to approach her and what the Lord would have him say. 

                On the 26th of November 2022, Ryan was led by the Lord to have a conversation
                with Oli. He intended to ask her out for a cup of coffee, but the Lord having
                other plans, Ryan asked her to marry him. Oli, of course, said yes. 

                “And my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by
                Christ Jesus. Now to God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen”
                - Philippians 4:19-20 -

                Though we have no idea what happens next, we are trusting the Lord to
                shape us into who He wants us to be; for His glory, for His kingdom, and
                in each other's lives. With every step, we are watching Him unfold all the
                details in His timing. We trust Him, and rather than leaning upon our own
                understanding, we lean upon His. He has never let us down, and we know He
                never will. We are excited to serve the One who loves us most, together.
